    <b>Defination of CPU</b>
    <p>A CPU is a computer's central processing unit. It is a circuit board tha performs the basic functons of a

        responsibleand data, and for the execution of programs. </p>
    <h2>CPU Components</h2>
    <p>1. Primary memory</p>
    <p>2. Secondary memory</p>
    <p>3. Processor</p>
    <p>5. Motherboard</p>
    <p>6. powersupply</p>
    <p>7. Cooling system</p>
    <p>8. GPU (graphis processing unit)</p>
    <h2> What is Primary Memory?</h2>
    <p>Primary memory is the memory that stores the data is being by the CPU. Ot is also known as the "Workink memory".
    </p>
    <p>Primary memory, is also known as main memory or RAM (Random Access Memory). </p>
    <h2>What is Secondary Memory?</h2>
    <p>Secondary memory is the memory that stores the instructions that the CPU executes. It is also known as the
        "Program Memory"</p>
    <p>Secondary memory, also known as secondary memory or ROM (Read Only Memory)</p>
    <h2>What is Processor?</h2>
    <p>The processor is the brain of the computer. It is responsible for performing the basic functions of a computer,
        such as arithmetic, logic, and input/output (I/O). The processor is the heart of a computer. It is responsible
        of instructions and data, and for the execution of programs.</p>
